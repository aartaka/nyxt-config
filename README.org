#+TITLE:My Nyxt Configuration Files

This is my repo with small tweaks to Nyxt that make it more comfortable and personal. Things of interest here:

BEWARE: I'm always using most recent Nyxt possible, often building from master branch. While I try to make my configuration portable, I may fail to do so for your version, especially if you're using any version other than latest stable or latest master. In particular, I'm going to drop all Nyxt 2.* configuration after the 3.0.0 release, so clone this if necessary.

* The hub of configuration (init.lisp for 2.*, config.lisp AND init.lisp for 3.*)
This loads other configuration files:
- Nyxt-dependent:
  - keybinds.lisp,
  - passwd.lisp,
  - slynk.lisp,
  - status.lisp,
  - style.lisp,
  - commands.lisp,
  - hsplit.lisp,
  - unpdf.lisp;
  - objdump.lisp;
- and extension-dependent:
  - ace.lisp
  - kaomoji.lisp
  - search-engines.lisp
  - freestance.lisp
  - dark-reader.lisp

And configures some basic things, like default modes for buffers.

Everything interesting is in other files.

There is also a ~load-after-system*~ portability macro to load system and its configuration file on both Nyxt 2 and Nyxt 3.

* Some custom keybindings (keybinds.lisp)

There are some things that irritate me in default keybindings (like =C-R= in =auto-mode= on 2.*) and I want to unbind/rebind these.

There are some commands that I lack keybindings for (e.g., password management, prompting history movement) and I want to add these.

A good example of how you can redefine mode keybinding there! There's also a portable (between 2.* and 3.*) macro to redefine the whole keymap-schemes â€” ~alter-keyscheme~.

* Alternative format for status-buffer (status.lisp)

I don't like the default wordy version of status-buffer (especially with long mode names), so I define my own styles and layouts to make it lighter.

This can evolve into an extension someday.

* Styling (style.lisp)

I love dark themes everywhere, and I _don't_ like any colors but red. This have made me to do black-red-and-green [[https://github.com/aartaka/laconia-theme][laconia-theme]]. I'm trying to reproduce it in style.lisp.

Right now it uses the 3.0 =theme= library (made by yours truly :P). If you're on 2.* Nyxt, see 1416f93927f6e91050da82e81dafe37e3e713ebf for the way of configuration that might work for you.

* Additional commands (commands.lisp)

I lack some things in Nyxt, like the ability to evaluate arbitrary Lisp expression without a REPL (there used to be a command for that in 1.5, but it was phased out) and horisontal split , so I hack those with some possibly non-portable things and internal Nyxt APIs. It's mostly 3.*-only.

* Hacky hsplit (hsplit.lisp)

It's too useful to have hsplit to not implement a hacky one based on panel buffers :P

* A barebones PDF text reader (unpdf.lisp)

This one leverages Nyxt 3.* improved request processing to redirect any PDF file I load to a separate buffer, where its text is parsed with ~pdftotext~. I like ~pdftotext~ (even if it's quite chaotic at times), so why not extend this passion to Nyxt? :P

* Experiments with objdump (objdump.lisp)

I cherish a dream of getting into reverse engineering, and ~objdump~ seems to be a good and simple utility to get one's feet wet. Thus, this simple ~objdump~ command to display section contents as a webpage.

* Lots of search engines for different things (search-engines.lisp)
This file has actually evolved from small configuration to an extension: [[https://github.com/aartaka/nx-search-engines][nx-search-engines]], so now it's basically an extension configuration. To use it, you need to do
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-after-system* :nx-search-engines (nyxt-init-file "search-engines.lisp"))
#+END_SRC
in your init.lisp.

* A KeePassXC configuration (passwd.lisp) 
This used to contain a =setup-keepassxc= function to setup KeePassXC to better work with built-in password interface. Now this function is merged upstream as part of this password interface, so what's left is just a simple re-configuration of defaults.

* Bookmarks relocation (bookmarks.lisp)

This is a file with all my bookmarks, Git-synced across devices. The snippet (in init.lisp) that enables it is:
#+begin_src lisp
  (defmethod files:resolve ((profile nyxt:nyxt-profile) (file nyxt/bookmark-mode:bookmarks-file))
    (uiop:parse-unix-namestring "~/.config/nyxt/bookmarks.lisp"))
#+end_src


* Ace editor inside Nyxt (ace.lisp)

This configures [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nx-ace][nx-ace]] to work as a default =editor-mode=. To enable it, you need to use
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-after-system* :nx-ace (nyxt-init-file "ace.lisp"))
#+END_SRC
in your init.lisp.

* Easy-to-paste Kaomojis (kaomoji.lisp)

I fell in love with Kaomojis, and I need an easy way to paste these in
my browser. That's why I made [[https://github.com/aartaka/nx-kaomoji][nx-kaomoji]]! Now I can paste
over-emotional responses everywhere!

This file is simply a keybinding configuration.
To enable nx-kaomoji, you need to use
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-after-system* :nx-kaomoji (nyxt-init-file "kaomoji.lisp"))
#+END_SRC
in your init.lisp.

* Using SLY with Nyxt (slynk.lisp)
This is a simple copy-paste from the [[https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/documents/README.org#sly][developer manual]], nothing interesting.

* Redirections to free alternatives for Twitter/YouTube
I rely on [[https://github.com/kssytsrk/nx-freestance-handler][kssytsrk/nx-freestance-handler]] here. It's mostly plug-n-play, so not much configuration there.

* A reasonable dark theme via Dark Reader
This is based on [[https://github.com/aartaka/nx-dark-reader][my extension]] using [[https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader][Dark Reader]] to offer a good dark theme for almost any website. Does nothing special -- simply configures some colors for Dark Reader to work better with my theme from [[Styling (style.lisp)][style.lisp]].
